# Prevent intermediate caches or proxies (such as those used by mobile
# network providers) and browsers data-saving features from modifying
# the website's content using the `no-transform` directive for
# `Cache-Control` header.

# (!) Carefully consider the impact on your visitors before disabling
#     content transformation. These transformations are performed to
#     improve the experience for data- and cost-constrained users
#     (e.g. users on a 2G connection).

# (!) If you are using `mod_pagespeed`, note that disabling this will
#     prevent `PageSpeed` from rewriting HTML files, and, if the
#     `ModPagespeedDisableRewriteOnNoTransform` directive isn't set to
#     `off`, also from rewriting other resources.
