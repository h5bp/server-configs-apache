# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Rewrite example.com â†’ www.example.com

# The same content should never be available under two different URLs,
# especially not with and without `www.` at the beginning.
# This can cause SEO problems (duplicate content), and therefore, you should
# choose one of the alternatives and redirect the other one.
#
# (!) NEVER USE BOTH WWW-RELATED RULES AT THE SAME TIME!

# (1) Set %{ENV:PROTO} variable, to allow rewrites to redirect with the
#     appropriate schema automatically (http or https).
#
# (2) The rule assumes by default that both HTTP and HTTPS environments are
#     available for redirection.
#     If your SSL certificate could not handle one of the domains used during
#     redirection, you should turn the condition on.

# Be aware that the following might not be a good idea if you use "real"
# subdomains for certain parts of your website.
