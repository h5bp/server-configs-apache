# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Drop requests for unknown hosts.
#
# If no default server is defined, Apache will use the first found server.
# To prevent host header attacks, or other potential problems when an unknown
# server name is used in a request, it's recommended to use an empty virtual host
# as the first loaded one.
#
# (1) In production, only secure hosts should be used (all `no-ssl` disabled).
#     If so, redirect first ANY request to a secure connection before handling
#     it, even if the host is unknown.
